# caseautomation
Code for semi-automated (dis)proof of theorems about maximum agreement forests (MAFs).

This is the (experimental) implementation of the case-checking code accompanying the article
"Computational support for case-heavy proofs in mathematical phylogenetics" by
Luca Forte, Leo van Iersel, Steven Kelk and Ruben Meuwese (December 2025).

High-level instructions for use can be found inside the article itself, while the README
inside the .tar gives more detailed instructions for use.

Any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards,

Steven Kelk, 18th December 2025.
